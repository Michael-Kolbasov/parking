The task is about autonomous parking lot. You should design and implement a backend system with
API to handle a parking lot.

Any client car, when arrives at the parking building, gets automatically scanned and its weight and
height are passed to the system as the car approaches the gate. The parking has N floors, where each
floor may have a different ceiling height and a different total weight capacity. The system must assign
the approaching car to the best suitable spot and calculate the resulting price per minute. The
payment, car transportation, and the rest is handled by other components, and you can simply
emulate them to build a business flow.

There are only few initial business requirements in that system, but it should be easily extensible. Try
to keep your code as readable as possible. We value code simplicity. Use object-oriented approach
with common design patterns where applicable.
